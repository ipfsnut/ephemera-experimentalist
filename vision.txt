# Ephemera Platform Vision

# Ephemera Platform Vision

## Core Architecture

1. Platform Layer (/platform/*)
- Dashboard and experiment discovery
- Global state and session management via PlatformContext
- Authentication and user tracking
- Common UI components and styling
- Platform-wide data collection through platformService

2. NST Implementation (/experiments/nst/*)
- Markov chain sequence generation
- Trial management and validation
- Response processing
- Results visualization
- Direct platform service integration

3. Experiment Framework (shared resources)
- Configuration inheritance
- Common UI components
- Data collection patterns
- Export capabilities

## API Structure
/api/platform/
- /health - Platform status
- /experiments - List available experiments
- /settings - Global platform settings
- /session - Session management

/api/experiments/nst/
- /config - NST-specific configuration
- /trials - Trial management
- /response - Response handling
- /results - Results storage

## Data Flow
Platform -> NST -> Framework
- Configuration flows down from platform
- Response data flows up through NST
- Session context maintained at platform level
- Trial state managed by NST implementation
