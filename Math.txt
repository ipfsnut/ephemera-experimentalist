NUMBER SWITCHING TASK - MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES

1. SWITCH PROBABILITY CALCULATION
Formula: switchProbability = (targetSwitches - switches) / (DIGITS_PER_TRIAL - i)

This dynamic probability ensures optimal distribution of switches across the sequence by:
- Tracking remaining required switches (targetSwitches - switches)
- Adjusting based on remaining digits (DIGITS_PER_TRIAL - i)
- Creating natural variation in switch timing

2. EFFORT LEVEL MAPPING
Progressive increase in cognitive load through controlled switch ranges:
Level 1: 1-2 switches  (minimal cognitive load)
Level 2: 3-4 switches
Level 3: 5-6 switches
Level 4: 7-8 switches  (moderate cognitive load)
Level 5: 9-10 switches
Level 6: 11-12 switches
Level 7: 13-14 switches (maximum cognitive load)

3. DIGIT GENERATION ALGORITHMS
Odd digits:  random(0-4) * 2 + 1 = [1,3,5,7,9]
Even digits: random(0-3) * 2 + 2 = [2,4,6,8]

4. MARKOV CHAIN PROPERTIES
- State transitions controlled by effort level parameters
- Uniform distribution within odd/even categories
- Probabilistic switch distribution across sequence length
- Guaranteed completion of required switches
- Maintained randomness within constraints

This system creates precisely controlled cognitive load while preserving unpredictability in the actual sequence presentation.
